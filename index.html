<h1> Why Kids Should Get Sleep</h1>
<p> The reason why kids should get sleep is because without sleep they will be grumpy and mean people. And nobody really likes grumpy people beause 
they are mean. Kids should get at least 7-9 hours of sleep but with homework and school work. They are not able to so it is counter proactive. That's why I think that school should be pushed back. So that we can get more sleep and not be grumpy little kids, we are young adults and should act like it. </p>
